### Hi XR Developers 🥽

I'm a highly motivated individual with a passion for XR and the goal to create useful products that make every day a little bit easier for other XR developers.

🔭 I’m currently: 
- 🙌 Creating [MR Motifs](https://github.com/oculus-samples/Unity-MRMotifs) and [other samples & showcases](https://github.com/oculus-samples) for Meta
- 👨‍🏫 Teaching XR development best practices on YouTube as [XR Dev Rob](https://www.youtube.com/@xrdevrob)
